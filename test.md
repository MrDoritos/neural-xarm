I would like everyone to be aware of the modern pharmacodynamics of DXM. Specifically the strong sedating aspect. If we followed a chronological train of thought evaluating the interactions of this molecule and your biology we can be more informed on the dangers of DXM overdose. It is common knowledge that DXM changes your perspective, as do all other drugs including reality, that would imply an additional dimension, the present dimension. Not just time and space, but gravity as it warps spacetime. Okay now I must prove time travel to be real, picture or dream yourself in the future, that's your imagination but also a point in space and time. Now travel to that point again including space in between. You aren't gonna understand this unless you are in the correct state of mind. One needs an equal amount of rest to stay alive. Or else you die. Ideally I prepared myself to start school. Except Discord, which is evil, because of bytedance, because of China. I cannot be lied to. Logically correct.
